return("While on <col=ffffff>Speedrunning Worlds</col>, you can select a <col=ffffff>quest</col> to speedrun from your <col=ffffff>Quest List</col>.<br><br>Selecting a quest will open the <col=ffffff>Speedrunning Panel</col>. From there, you can view information on the quest. You can then use the <col=ffffff>Set Up Speedrun</col> button to teleport to the <col=ffffff>start point</col>. Doing so will also give you the relevant <col=ffffff>unlocks</col> and <col=ffffff>items</col> for the quest.<br><br>Once you have selected a quest, the speedrun will begin as soon as you <col=ffffff>start</col> it. This will start a <col=ffffff>timer</col> that is displayed on your screen. The timer doesn't stop until the quest is <col=ffffff>complete</col>. <col=ffffff>Logging out</col> will pause the timer, with it resuming when you next <col=ffffff>log in</col>.<br><br>If you're fast enough, you'll unlock a <col=ffffff>Speedrun Trophy</col> upon quest completion. Each quest has <col=ffffff>Bronze</col>, <col=ffffff>Silver</col>, <col=ffffff>Gold</col> and <col=ffffff>Platinum</col> trophies to unlock. The times needed for each trophy are detailed on the <col=ffffff>Speedrunning Panel</col>.<br><br>Unlocking trophies will earn you <col=ffffff>Speedrun Points</col>. Each Bronze Trophy gives <col=ffffff><tostring(10)> points</col>, each Silver Trophy gives <col=ffffff><tostring(30)> points</col>, each Gold Trophy gives <col=ffffff><tostring(80)> points</col> and each Platinum Trophy gives <col=ffffff><tostring(200)> points</col>.<br><br>Any points you earn while speedrunning are transferred over to your <col=ffffff>main profile</col>. They can then be spent in a <col=ffffff>Rewards Shop</col> found in <col=ffffff>Varrock Square</col>.");
